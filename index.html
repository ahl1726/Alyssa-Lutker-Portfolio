                        <p> My visual story, Mussel(ing) through to Conserve an Endangered Species, covers the
decline of native mussel populations in Wisconsin waterways due to the threat of dams and zebra mussels. Through the StoryMap I have developed, I want readers to understand there is an issue and how they can help take action. Within the StoryMap, I created the bivariate map of dam and zebra mussel presence, using data from the WIDNR and the Non-indigenous Aquatic Species department of the United
States Geological Survey. I also shot and edited the video included at the bottom, as part of a paddle trip I attended with River Alliance of Wisconsin and WIDNR mussel experts.</p>

                        <p> Using Mapbox, I created a themed map based off the 90's show, "The Magic School Bus." I utilized a color scheme that drew from Ms. Frizzle's purple outfits and orange hair; Liz, the lizard's green skin; and the school bus' yellow body and light blue windows. I also found a font that is close to the iconic font used for the show's title and applied it to my continent, country, state and city labels. In addition, I purposely focused on natural features, since her field trips are focused on science, and I included UNESCO heritage sites as possible points of interest for her future field trips. All of these design choices can be seen when zooming in and out of the map, which is accessible at the bottom of my design explanation page. </p>

                        <p> As my final project for my Graphic Design in Cartography class, I created a StoryMap that provides a visual story of how PFAS impact us, specifically in Dane County and the state of Wisconsin. I utilized different tools to provide a comprehensive story, including creating an infographic of products containing PFAS; creating maps using ArcGIS online and embedding an existing map from WIDNR; and providing numerous hyperlinks to news story narratives and informational resources that add to the overall story but prevent this specific resource from becoming overcrowded. There are so many great resources on PFAS contamination, and my goal was to create a comprehensive story that brought some of those resources together and help viewers understand from point source to global scale how PFAS contaminate our environment and lives. </p>
